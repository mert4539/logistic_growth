# Modelling E.coli population growth

## Description
The goal of this analysis is to model the population growth of E.coli bacteria. More specifically, the project estimates the initial population size (N), the growth rate (r), and the carrying capacity (K) in a reproducible manner. This is achieved by plotting the data, fitting a linear model, and evaluating the fit of the model to the data. The analysis is carried out in R scripts on Posit cloud, and subsequently pushed to GitHub.
